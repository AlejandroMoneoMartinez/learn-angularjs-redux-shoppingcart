============================

Follow the example of Example of AngularJS + Redux.
Complete so:

- Can increase or decrease product count
- Update total price for each product
- Update global cart count (number total of items)

Add necessary actions, containers and selectors.
Update components to have necessary bindings, but do not add controllers to them.
